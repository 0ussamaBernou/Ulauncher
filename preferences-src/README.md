# Ulauncher Preferences

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```

To debug the preferences, kill Ulauncher and reopen it with the `--dev` flag. Then you can right click and open the inspector.
